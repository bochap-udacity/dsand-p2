# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

## Problem

In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

## Requirements

Python version 3.6 and above

## Solution

The solution performs a single traversal over the entire list to obtain the max and min so the time complexity is O(n). The space complexity is O(1) since it only uses a few variables to store the max and min values.
